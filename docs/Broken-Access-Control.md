## Introduction : What is Access Control 

> **üîó Check out the full website version of this guide here: (https://Averageprogrammer205.github.io/Offensivesec-kit/Broken-Access-Control)**

**Broken Access Control** is one of the most _abused_, _misunderstood_, and _dangerous_ vulnerability classes. Why? Because **Access Control** is what stops users from doing things they‚Äôre not supposed to do ‚Äî like viewing other people‚Äôs data, deleting someone else's account, or acting like an admin.  
If _that_ is broken, a regular user can become unstoppable.

This guide will teach you:

- What BAC really is (beyond textbook definitions),  
- What it can look like in the wild,  
- Where and how to hunt for it like a real attacker,  
- How to test it, prove it, and explain the impact,  
- And how to fix it (yes, fixing matters if you want respect).

We‚Äôll wrap up with real examples and a complete checklist to help you recognize BAC anywhere.

## üß† What is Broken Access Control?

Access control stops users from doing things they‚Äôre not allowed to do. It prevents:

- A regular user from accessing admin functionality  
- A customer from viewing someone else‚Äôs data  
- Any low-privilege actor from performing high-privilege actions

It‚Äôs the thing that says:  
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù

**Broken Access Control** is when someone finds a way to bypass that restriction.

When access control fails, users can:

- View or modify other users‚Äô accounts  
- Escalate privileges horizontally or vertically  
- Perform unauthorized business functions like issuing refunds or deleting data reserved for admins

## Core Broken Access Control Vulnerabilities

(To clear out confusion:**Broken Access Control** is a familiy of bugs, BAC by itself is not a bug)

Now that we know what *Access Control* is and Why *Broken Access Control* is dangerous, let's look at the core of BAC vulnerabilities, starting with **IDOR** or **Indirect Object Reference**,
