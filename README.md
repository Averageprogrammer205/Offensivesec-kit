# Offensivesec-kit
A growing bug bounty hunting toolkit built through disciplined learning and real attempts.

This repo is my space to:

Share practical how-to guides as I learn new vulnerabilities and techniques

Develop and organize simple tools and scripts to aid in recon and testing

Document bug writeups and lessons from valid findings, once I start getting them

This is a work in progress, open for anyone serious about leveling up with me.
