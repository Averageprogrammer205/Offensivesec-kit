# My Bug Bounty Journey & Learning Repo

This is my personal bug bounty learning space — where I create **one solid guide at a time** and store **all my findings and reports**.

---

## What’s This For?

- I learn by teaching myself through writing detailed guides.  
- Every guide you see here is something I’ve worked hard to understand and master.  
- Tools? They’re coming soon — scripts to help with recon, automation, and more.  
- I keep all my bug bounty reports here too, as proof of real work, but they will have no pay because of age and country restrictions.

## How You Can Use It

- Follow the guides to learn with me.  
- Watch this space for new tools and scripts.  
- Check out the bug reports to see how I apply what I learn.
